The example data in this directory is structered in the following format:

b1 denotes the b quark with larger pt, b2 denotes the one with smaller pt.

l1 denotes the lepton that correctly pair with b1, l2 denotes the lepton pairs with b2.

met denotes the missing transverse energy/momemtum.

The corresponding index and data is

0 b1.E, 1 b1.px, 2 b1.py, 3 b1.pz, 4 l1.E, 5 l1.px, 6 l1.py, 7 l1.pz, 8 b2.E, 9 b2.px, 10 b2.py, 12 b1.pz, 12 l2.E, 13 l2.px, 14 l2.py, 15 l2.pz, 16 met.px, 17 met.py 

The other values in the data files are variables we calculated that may or may not be used in this repository.

18 mbl_max_correct, 19 mbl_max_incorrect, 20 mt2_correct, 21 mt2_incorrect, 22 m2cw_correct, 23 m2cw_incorrect, 24 m2ct_correct, 25 m2ct_incorrect, 26 log(topness_correct), 27 log(topness_incorrect)

where correct or incorrect corrospond to whether the named variables are calculated from the correct pairing or not.
